**Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [简体中文](README_zh.md)**

Kage is a universal Live2D renderer that provides an interaction API. It was originally designed as a standalone Live2D extension for [Petto](https://github.com/funnycups/petto), but it can also work independently.

Decorate your desktop with a cute pet!

## Features

Kage provides a WebSocket API that allows external programs to interact with Live2D models. The main features include:

*   **Model Control**: Load/switch models, get/trigger motions, get/set/clear expressions.
*   **Container Control**: Modify the size and position of the model container.
*   **Interaction**: Display text messages above the model.
*   **System Control**: Get version information, exit/restart the application.

For detailed API documentation, please refer to [API.md](API.md).

## Supported Systems

*   Windows

*   Linux

## Getting Started

*   Download the Kage release package.
*   Extract it to any location on your computer.
*   Run Kage.
*   Done! Now you can interact with the Live2D model through the WebSocket API.
